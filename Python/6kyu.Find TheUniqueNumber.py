# There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
# find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
# find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
# Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
# The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

def find_uniq(arr):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    if arr[0] == arr[1]:
        return arr[-1]
    else: 
        return arr[0]   # n: unique integer in the array
