# 7kyu - Find the next perfect square!

# You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
# Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. 
# Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
# If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.
# Examples:
# findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144
# findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect

def find_next_square(sq):
    if int(sq ** 0.5) < sq ** 0.5:
        return -1
    else:
        return ((sq ** 0.5) + 1)**2
